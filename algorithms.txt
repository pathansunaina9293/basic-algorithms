Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers
start
Take a positive integer n as input.
Use a loop (for or while) to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n and add them together.
Display the sum.
end

Problem 2: Check for Prime Number
start
Take a positive integer n.
If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
If n is 2, it is prime (since 2 is the smallest prime number).
For any number greater than 2, check if n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not prime.
Return True if the number is prime, otherwise False.
end

Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers
start
Take three numbers a, b, and c.
Compare a, b, and c to find the largest number.
Use conditional statements to check which number is greater.
Print the largest number among the three.
end

Problem 4: Factorial Calculation
start
Take a positive integer n.
If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1 (since 0!=1!=1).
For numbers greater than 1, multiply all integers from 1 to n to compute the factorial.
Return the factorial of n.
end

Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
start
Take an integer n.
If the number n is divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 == 0), then n is even.
If the number n is not divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 != 0), then n is odd.
Print whether the number is even or odd.
end.
